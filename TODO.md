* direction should be a string
* how do we define "inbound" - shape order?
* error logging
* configure CORS
* idempotent line simplification - cut out points that are less than 1 minute apart? or distance?
* flesh out README
* add another agency (timezone!) - agency Id and nextbus agency no match
* Indexes should be culled to last scheduled stop.
* media queries broken, and not very mobile friendly
* look at other agencies for directions
* add a "Now" line

Future features:
* store stop_id -> latlong to show on map?
