* how do i find the route name etc?, PM, PH, C cable cars
* place to list all available routes.
* agency ids and nextbus agencys dont match
* directions are backwards
* direction should be a string
* combine schedules and stops
* error logging
* configure CORS
* idempotent line simplification - cut out points that are less than 1 minute apart? or distance?
* flesh out README
* add another agency (timezone!)
* how do we define "inbound" - shape order?
* Indexes should be culled to last scheduled stop.
* trip headsigns
* media queries broken, and not very mobile friendly

Future features:
